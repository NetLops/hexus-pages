            <p class="article-lead">After decades of promises and setbacks, fusion power has finally arrived. The SPARC reactor in Devens, Massachusetts, began delivering electricity to the New England grid yesterday—marking the dawn of a new energy era that could solve climate change within a generation.</p>

            <h2>The Promise Fulfilled</h2>
            <p>For seventy years, fusion power was perpetually "30 years away." Critics mocked it as an impossible dream, a black hole for research funding that would never deliver. Yesterday, those critics were silenced.</p>

            <p>At 6:47 AM Eastern Time, the SPARC reactor achieved sustained fusion ignition and began producing 400 megawatts of clean electricity—enough to power 350,000 homes. The reaction ran continuously for 18 hours before operators deliberately shut it down for inspection.</p>

            <blockquote>"This isn't an experiment anymore. This is baseload power generation. We've done it. Fusion works."</blockquote>

            <h2>How SPARC Succeeded</h2>
            <p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the MIT spinoff behind SPARC, credits breakthroughs in high-temperature superconducting magnets. Their compact tokamak design generates magnetic fields four times stronger than previous designs, confining the 100-million-degree plasma in a reactor small enough to fit in a gymnasium.</p>

            <p>The fuel? Deuterium extracted from seawater—effectively unlimited—and tritium bred within the reactor itself. No carbon emissions. No long-lived nuclear waste. No meltdown risk.</p>

            <h2>The Economics of Abundance</h2>
            <p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced electricity costs of 4.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, competitive with natural gas and undercutting coal. As manufacturing scales, they project costs dropping to under 2 cents by 2030.</p>

            <p>This changes everything. Energy scarcity has driven human conflict since the first fire was lit. Fusion offers a future where clean energy is too cheap to meter—powering direct air capture of CO2, desalination of seawater, vertical farming, and technologies we haven't yet imagined.</p>

            <h2>Global Implications</h2>
            <p>Oil prices plummeted 15% on the news. Solar and wind stocks paradoxically rose, as investors bet fusion will accelerate rather than replace the clean energy transition. Coal and natural gas companies saw catastrophic losses.</p>

            <p>Geopolitically, the implications are seismic. Nations dependent on fossil fuel exports—Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela—face existential economic threats. The petrodollar system that has underpinned global finance for half a century may be ending.</p>

            <h2>The Race to Scale</h2>
            <p>SPARC is just the beginning. Commonwealth Fusion Systems has broken ground on ARC, a 1.5-gigawatt commercial plant scheduled for 2028. China's EAST program has announced accelerated timelines. The EU's ITER project, long criticized for delays, is suddenly racing to prove relevance.</p>

            <p>The fusion age has begun. And with it, humanity's greatest hope for a sustainable future.</p>
