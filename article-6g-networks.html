        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="article-lead">While the world was still arguing about 5G, researchers have quietly achieved 6G transmission speeds of 1 terabit per second—1,000 times faster than the best 5G networks. The first commercial 6G networks launch in South Korea and Japan next month, promising to make connectivity as invisible and ubiquitous as air.</p>

            <h2>Speed Beyond Comprehension</h2>
            <p>At 1 Tbps, you could download every movie ever made in under a minute. But speed is almost beside the point. What matters is what becomes possible when bandwidth is essentially infinite and latency drops below one millisecond.</p>

            <p>Remote surgery becomes indistinguishable from being in the room. Holographic communication replaces video calls. Autonomous vehicles communicate with each other and infrastructure in real-time, preventing accidents before they happen.</p>

            <blockquote>"We're not building faster phones. We're building the nervous system for a planetary intelligence."</blockquote>

            <h2>The Terahertz Frontier</h2>
            <p>6G operates in the terahertz frequency band, previously considered unusable due to atmospheric absorption. Breakthrough antenna designs using metamaterials and advanced beamforming have solved the propagation challenges.</p>

            <p>The new frequencies enable something remarkable: networks can sense the environment. 6G base stations double as radar systems, detecting movement, tracking objects, and even monitoring vital signs at a distance. Privacy implications are staggering.</p>

            <h2>AI-Native Networks</h2>
            <p>Unlike previous generations where AI was bolted on afterward, 6G is AI-native. Machine learning algorithms manage spectrum allocation, predict demand, and optimize routing in real-time. The network essentially thinks.</p>

            <p>This intelligence enables unprecedented efficiency. 6G networks will consume 90% less energy per bit than 5G while delivering 100 times the capacity. In an era of climate crisis, this efficiency is crucial.</p>

            <h2>The Coverage Revolution</h2>
            <p>Low-earth orbit satellite constellations integrate seamlessly with terrestrial 6G. Dead zones disappear. Whether you're in the Sahara Desert, the Pacific Ocean, or the Amazon rainforest, you'll have multi-gigabit connectivity.</p>

            <p>This has profound implications for global equality. A farmer in rural Kenya will have the same network access as a trader in Manhattan. Education, healthcare, and economic opportunity become location-independent.</p>

            <h2>What Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>Technologies waiting for 6G to become viable:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>True mixed reality that blends physical and digital seamlessly</li>
                <li>Digital twins of entire cities updated in real-time</li>
                <li>Haptic internet enabling touch over distance</li>
                <li>Brain-computer interfaces requiring massive, instant bandwidth</li>
                <li>Swarm robotics with thousands of coordinated machines</li>
            </ul>

            <p>5G was evolution. 6G is revolution. By 2030, the world will be connected in ways that make today's internet look like telegraph wires. The invisible revolution has begun.</p>
