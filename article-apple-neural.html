            <p class="article-lead">At a surprise event this morning, Apple announced the N1—a non-invasive neural interface chip that reads brain signals through the skin. No surgery required. Pre-orders begin immediately, with shipping in March 2026. The post-smartphone era officially has a start date.</p>

            <h2>Think Different, Literally</h2>
            <p>The N1 is a small adhesive device worn behind the ear, resembling a hearing aid. Using advanced magnetoencephalography sensors miniaturized through Apple's custom silicon, it detects neural activity with 94% accuracy—approaching surgical implant performance without breaking the skin.</p>

            <p>"We've spent a decade on this," said CEO Tim Cook. "The iPhone put the internet in your pocket. The N1 puts computing in your thoughts."</p>

            <blockquote>"No screens. No keyboards. No gestures. Just think what you want, and it happens. This is the interface we were always meant to have."</blockquote>

            <h2>What It Actually Does</h2>
            <p>Initial capabilities focus on hands-free device control:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Control any Apple device through thought alone</li>
                <li>Dictate messages at 120 words per minute—three times faster than typing</li>
                <li>Navigate AR environments without controllers</li>
                <li>Compose music by imagining sounds</li>
                <li>Accessibility features for users with mobility impairments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The device pairs with Vision Pro, iPhone, Mac, and a new category of "ambient" Apple devices designed for thought control. Siri becomes genuinely conversational when you can think your half of the dialogue.</p>

            <h2>Privacy by Design</h2>
            <p>Apple has preemptively addressed the elephant in the room: your thoughts are yours. All neural processing happens on-device using the N1's dedicated Apple Silicon. No thought data ever leaves your hardware. No training on neural patterns. No cloud processing.</p>

            <p>"We don't want to know what you're thinking," Cook emphasized. "We've built a system where it's technically impossible for anyone—including us—to access your neural data."</p>

            <h2>The Developer Platform</h2>
            <p>NeuralKit, Apple's API for thought-controlled apps, launches alongside the hardware. Early partners include Epic Games, Adobe, Spotify, and meditation app Calm. Developers can request specific thought patterns without accessing underlying neural data—a privacy-preserving approach Apple calls "cognitive intents."</p>

            <h2>The Competition Responds</h2>
            <p>Neuralink's surgical approach suddenly looks invasive. Meta's brain-reading wristband feels primitive. Google has reportedly canceled its neural interface project entirely, unwilling to compete with Apple's head start.</p>

            <p>The N1 is priced at $1,299—expensive, but comparable to the original iPhone. Analysts predict 50 million units sold in the first year, with prices dropping to $499 by 2028.</p>

            <p>The age of thought-controlled computing has arrived. And like the iPhone before it, it comes with an Apple logo.</p>
