            <p class="article-lead">TSMC and Samsung have both begun mass production of 2-nanometer chips, transistors so small that quantum effects threaten their very operation. After six decades, Moore's Law is finally hitting the walls of physics. What comes next will redefine computing entirely.</p>

            <h2>The Atomic Limit</h2>
            <p>At 2 nanometers, transistor gates are roughly 10 atoms wide. Electrons begin behaving as waves rather than particles, tunneling through barriers that should be impenetrable. The classical physics that made semiconductors possible breaks down at this scale.</p>

            <p>"We're not engineering silicon anymore," explains TSMC's head of R&D, Dr. Wei-Jen Lo. "We're negotiating with quantum mechanics. Every generation gets exponentially harder."</p>

            <h2>GAA: The Final Architecture</h2>
            <p>Both foundries have adopted Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor architecture, where the gate wraps completely around the channel, maximizing control over electron flow. It's an engineering marvel—and likely the last conventional transistor design we'll ever see.</p>

            <blockquote>"2nm GAA transistors represent the pinnacle of 60 years of scaling. Beyond this, we're not improving transistors—we're reinventing computing itself."</blockquote>

            <h2>The Performance Numbers</h2>
            <p>Despite the challenges, 2nm delivers impressive gains:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>45% performance improvement over 3nm at same power</li>
                <li>75% power reduction at same performance</li>
                <li>Transistor density of 490 million per square millimeter</li>
                <li>AI inference capability increased by 3.2x</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Apple's M5 chip, launching next spring on 2nm, will pack 80 billion transistors—more than any consumer chip in history.</p>

            <h2>The $40 Billion Fab</h2>
            <p>Building 2nm chips requires fabrication facilities costing $40 billion or more. Only three companies can afford the investment: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines cost $200 million each and require their own power substations.</p>

            <p>This consolidation has profound geopolitical implications. A single earthquake in Taiwan or sanctions on South Korea could paralyze the global technology industry.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Silicon</h2>
            <p>The industry is already looking past 2nm. Research directions include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Carbon nanotube transistors offering 10x efficiency gains</li>
                <li>3D stacked chiplets communicating through silicon interposers</li>
                <li>Neuromorphic chips that mimic brain architecture</li>
                <li>Quantum processors for specialized workloads</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Moore's Law as originally defined—transistor counts doubling every two years—may be ending. But compute power will continue advancing through architectural innovation, new materials, and radically different approaches to computation.</p>

            <p>The silicon era isn't ending. It's evolving into something we don't yet have a name for.</p>
