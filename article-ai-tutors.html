        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="article-lead">A 10-year-old in rural Kenya is learning calculus from the same AI tutor as a student in Manhattan. A struggling reader in Brazil receives infinitely patient one-on-one instruction. A gifted teenager in Japan moves through an entire physics curriculum in months. The one-size-fits-all era of education is ending.</p>

            <p>AI tutoring platforms have crossed a critical threshold. They're no longer supplements to traditional schooling—they're becoming replacements. And the data suggests they're working better than anyone expected.</p>

            <h2>The Personalization Promise</h2>
            <p>Every student learns differently. Some need visual explanations; others prefer hands-on examples. Some need concepts repeated ten times; others grasp them instantly. Traditional classrooms could never fully accommodate these differences.</p>

            <p>AI tutors can. They adapt in real-time, adjusting pace, style, and approach based on continuous assessment. Results from platforms like Khan Academy's Khanmigo show students learning 2-3 times faster than traditional classroom rates.</p>

            <h2>The Equity Question</h2>
            <p>For decades, quality education has been determined by geography and economics. AI tutoring could be the great equalizer. The Minerva Project has deployed AI tutors to 100,000 students in underserved communities across Africa and South Asia with remarkable results.</p>

            <p>But the digital divide remains real. Students without reliable internet or devices are falling further behind.</p>

            <h2>What Schools Were Really For</h2>
            <p>Education has always been about more than knowledge transfer. Schools socialize children, teaching them to navigate peer relationships and develop emotional intelligence. Critics warn that optimization for academic outcomes misses the point.</p>

            <p>"We're creating very knowledgeable people who don't know how to be people," argues education philosopher Sugata Mitra.</p>

            <h2>The Hybrid Future</h2>
            <p>The most promising models blend AI and human elements. Students learn academic content from AI tutors at home, then come to school for collaborative projects and social activities. Teachers become facilitators rather than lecturers—the role is different, but arguably more valuable.</p>
