            <p class="article-lead">Forget smartwatches and fitness bands. The future of wearable technology isn't something you strap on—it's something you put on like any other shirt, jacket, or pair of pants. Smart fabrics are turning clothing into a computing platform.</p>

            <p>At this year's Paris Fashion Week, models walked the runway in garments that pulsed with embedded LEDs, changed color in response to touch, and displayed real-time biometric data. These weren't art installations—they were products shipping within months.</p>

            <h2>The Fabric of Technology</h2>
            <p>Smart fabrics integrate sensors, actuators, and connectivity directly into textile fibers. Conductive threads carry electrical signals. Piezoelectric fibers generate power from movement. Thermochromic materials change color with temperature.</p>

            <p>The breakthroughs enabling this revolution include flexible electronics that survive washing, energy harvesting from body heat, and manufacturing processes that weave technology into fabrics at scale.</p>

            <h2>Health on Your Sleeve</h2>
            <p>Medical applications are leading adoption. Smart shirts continuously monitor heart rate, breathing patterns, and posture. For patients with chronic conditions, this means constant health surveillance without intrusive devices.</p>

            <p>Diabetic socks with integrated sensors detect early signs of foot ulcers. Compression garments with embedded actuators adjust pressure dynamically. The line between clothing and medical device is disappearing.</p>

            <h2>Athletic Enhancement</h2>
            <p>Professional athletes now train in smart compression suits that provide real-time feedback on muscle activation, form, and fatigue. The data enables unprecedented optimization of training regimens and injury prevention.</p>

            <h2>Fashion Forward</h2>
            <p>Beyond function, smart fabrics enable new forms of self-expression. Garments that shift patterns based on mood, respond to music, or display digital art are entering the mainstream market.</p>

            <p>The technology is still expensive, but costs are falling rapidly. Within five years, smart fabric features will be as common as smartphone connectivity is today.</p>
