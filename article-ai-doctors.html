        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="article-lead">The results from the landmark ARTEMIS trial are unambiguous: across 50,000 patients in 12 countries, AI diagnostic systems outperformed human physicians in accuracy, speed, and consistency. The implications for global healthcare are profound.</p>

            <p>In the study published last week in The Lancet, an AI system correctly diagnosed conditions in 94.7% of cases, compared to 83.1% for board-certified specialists and 71.2% for general practitioners. Perhaps more striking: the AI caught early-stage cancers that human doctors missed in 23% of cases reviewed.</p>

            <h2>The Data Advantage</h2>
            <p>No human doctor can read every medical journal, review every case study, or remember every drug interaction. AI systems have no such limitations. The latest medical AI models have been trained on billions of patient records, millions of research papers, and decades of clinical data.</p>

            <p>"The AI doesn't get tired at 3 AM. It doesn't have cognitive biases. It considers every possible diagnosis simultaneously rather than anchoring on the most likely one," explains Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute.</p>

            <h2>Radiology Revolution</h2>
            <p>Medical imaging was the first domain where AI matched human experts, and it remains the most transformed. AI systems now read mammograms, CT scans, and MRIs with superhuman accuracy. Many radiology departments have already integrated AI as a "second reader."</p>

            <p>The latest systems go further. They can predict future health events from current images—identifying patients at high risk for heart attacks years before symptoms appear.</p>

            <h2>The Human Element</h2>
            <p>But medicine isn't just diagnosis. It's holding a patient's hand during bad news. It's understanding the social context that affects treatment compliance. These elements remain stubbornly human.</p>

            <p>"AI tells you what's wrong with the body. It doesn't understand the person living in that body," says Dr. Atul Gawande. The emerging model is AI-augmented care: artificial intelligence handling diagnosis while human clinicians focus on complex cases and emotional support.</p>

            <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
            <p>Within a decade, receiving care without AI involvement will seem as archaic as medicine without imaging or lab tests. The doctor's role will evolve, as it has through every technological revolution in medicine's history. The AI won't replace the doctor—but the doctor who uses AI will replace the one who doesn't.</p>
