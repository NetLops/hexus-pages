            <p class="article-lead">A small capsule containing 47 kilograms of platinum-group metals splashed down in the Pacific Ocean last week, marking humanity's first successful commercial asteroid mining mission. The samples are valued at approximately $2.1 billion—and they're just the beginning.</p>

            <p>AstroForge's Prospector-1 mission, launched 26 months ago, rendezvoused with near-Earth asteroid 2019 OQ5, extracted material using a novel magnetic separation system, and returned to Earth with a payload that fundamentally changes the economics of space resources.</p>

            <h2>The Platinum Prize</h2>

            <p>Platinum-group metals—platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium—are extraordinarily rare on Earth but abundant in certain asteroids. These metals are essential for catalytic converters, electronics, hydrogen fuel cells, and various industrial processes.</p>

            <p>"A single 500-meter asteroid can contain more platinum-group metals than have ever been mined in human history," explains AstroForge CEO Matt Gialich. "We're not competing with terrestrial mining. We're accessing a resource base that dwarfs anything on Earth."</p>

            <p>The Prospector-1 samples contain concentrations of platinum-group metals roughly 100 times higher than the richest terrestrial ores. Analysis is ongoing, but initial results confirm the commercial viability of asteroid mining at scale.</p>

            <h2>The Business Case</h2>

            <p>AstroForge's mission cost approximately $350 million—a fraction of traditional space exploration budgets. The $2.1 billion return represents a roughly 6x return on investment, although the company notes that development costs for the technology extend the true breakeven timeline.</p>

            <p>"The first mission is always the most expensive," notes space economist Dr. Helen Cheng. "As reusability improves and mission frequency increases, costs will drop dramatically. We're seeing the same pattern that made commercial satellite launches economical."</p>

            <h2>Legal Frontiers</h2>

            <p>The legal framework for asteroid mining remains contested. The 2015 U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act grants American companies the right to own resources extracted from asteroids, but international acceptance is incomplete.</p>

            <p>Russia and several other nations argue that space resources should be treated as the common heritage of humanity, not private property. The successful return of valuable asteroid materials is intensifying these debates.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Implications</h2>

            <p>Asteroid mining could dramatically reduce the environmental impact of terrestrial mining. Extracting rare metals from asteroids produces no acid mine drainage, no habitat destruction, and no toxic waste disposal challenges.</p>

            <p>"Every kilogram of platinum we bring back from space is a kilogram we didn't have to blast out of a mountain," argues environmental economist Dr. Patricia Green. "The externalities of space mining are minimal compared to terrestrial alternatives."</p>

            <h2>The Next Phase</h2>

            <p>AstroForge has already announced Prospector-2, targeting a larger asteroid with an estimated resource value exceeding $50 billion. Competitors are emerging: TransAstra, Karman+, and several Chinese state-backed ventures have announced asteroid mining programs.</p>

            <p>The first samples are safely on Earth. The space mining industry has arrived.</p>
