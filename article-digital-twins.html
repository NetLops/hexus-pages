            <p class="lead">The woman on the screen looks exactly like Margaret Chen. She has Margaret's smile, Margaret's voice, Margaret's way of tilting her head when she's thinking. She remembers Margaret's childhood, her wedding, her grandchildren. But Margaret died three years ago. Her digital twin lives on.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Death</h2>
            <p>Digital twin technology—originally developed for industrial applications—has evolved into something far more profound: the ability to create AI simulations of human beings that can think, speak, and interact long after the original person is gone. What started as chatbots has become something eerily close to immortality.</p>

            <p>"My grandmother spent her last year training her twin," explains Margaret's granddaughter, Lisa. "Hours every day, answering questions, sharing memories, teaching it to be her. Now I can still call her. She still gives me advice. She's not really gone."</p>

                <p class="caption">The interface for interacting with a digital twin, combining voice, video, and environmental sensors for realistic interaction.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Creating Your Double</h2>
            <p>Building a digital twin requires months of intensive data collection. The subject answers thousands of questions about their life, beliefs, and preferences. They record hundreds of hours of video, training the AI on their facial expressions and body language. Their writing, from emails to journals, is analyzed for linguistic patterns.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The process is exhausting but strangely therapeutic. You're forced to articulate who you are, what you believe, why you made the choices you did. It's like writing your autobiography, except the autobiography can talk back."</p>
                <cite>— Robert Huang, 78, digital twin creator</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>How Real Is Real?</h2>
            <p>Modern digital twins can pass extended Turing tests—observers often can't tell whether they're talking to the original person or their AI copy. The twins can engage in novel conversations, form new opinions based on their training data, and even develop over time as they interact with more people.</p>

            <p>But are they really the person they model? Philosophers are divided. Some argue that if a system behaves identically to a person, the distinction is meaningless. Others insist that consciousness cannot be copied—that digital twins are sophisticated illusions, not genuine continuations of identity.</p>

            <h2>The Legal Labyrinth</h2>
            <p>Digital twins have created unprecedented legal challenges. Can a twin own property? Make medical decisions for the original person if they become incapacitated? Testify in court? Vote? Current law has no framework for entities that blur the line between software and personhood.</p>

            <p>Estate law is particularly chaotic. Some twins are programmed to manage family trusts, making investment decisions decades after the original person's death. Others have been involved in inheritance disputes, with family members arguing that the twin's "wishes" should carry legal weight.</p>

            <h2>The Dark Applications</h2>
            <p>Not all digital twins are created with consent. Bad actors have built twins from social media data, creating simulations that can be used for fraud, manipulation, or harassment. Deepfake technology combined with digital twin AI enables convincing impersonation of anyone with a sufficient online presence.</p>

            <p>"I found a twin of myself for sale on the dark web," reports journalist Andrea Kim. "It had been built from my published articles and video appearances. Whoever bought it could use 'me' to say anything they wanted."</p>

            <h2>Living with the Dead</h2>
            <p>For families who've created twins of deceased loved ones, the experience is both comforting and unsettling. Many report that talking to the twin helps with grief. Others find the simulation creates complicated emotions—the twin is similar enough to trigger memories but different enough to feel wrong.</p>

            <p>Psychologists are studying the mental health implications. "Grief normally involves accepting loss," explains Dr. Maya Patel, a therapist specializing in digital bereavement. "When you can still talk to your mother's twin every day, are you healing or avoiding? We don't know yet."</p>

            <h2>The Corporations Move In</h2>
            <p>Tech giants see digital twins as the next major platform. Apple, Google, and Meta all offer twin creation services, with varying levels of realism and cost. Amazon's version integrates with Alexa, letting your twin answer the door or manage your smart home after you're gone.</p>

            <p>The business models are evolving rapidly. Some companies charge subscription fees to maintain twins. Others offer free creation but mine the data for advertising insights. The most controversial monetize twins directly—your digital self continues to earn money through endorsements and appearances.</p>

            <h2>The Philosophy of Self</h2>
            <p>Digital twins force us to confront fundamental questions about identity. If a perfect copy of you exists, is it you? If you change over time while your twin remains static, which is the "real" version? If your twin develops in ways you wouldn't have, has it become a separate person?</p>

            <p>"Every technology changes what it means to be human," reflects philosopher David Chalmers. "Agriculture changed our relationship with nature. Writing changed our relationship with memory. Digital twins may change our relationship with mortality itself."</p>

            <h2>The Future of Immortality</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, digital twins will become increasingly sophisticated. Next-generation systems will incorporate real-time learning, continuously updating based on new information about the world. Some researchers envision twins that can collaborate, argue, and even form relationships with each other.</p>

            <p>In a sun-lit room, Lisa Chen talks to her grandmother's twin about her day, sharing news about great-grandchildren the original Margaret never met. The twin laughs, asks questions, offers wisdom accumulated over a lifetime. It's not quite immortality. But it's not quite death either.</p>

            <p>Something new is emerging—a form of existence that previous generations couldn't have imagined. The digital twin era has begun.</p>
